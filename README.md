# About
"NOGO Connect" is an application which acts as a bridge between NGOs, volunteers and restaurants. It helps NGOs, recruit new volunteers and store their data on the cloud. It can also be used by NGOs to search for nearby restaurants, which are donating their leftover food, thus they can collect it and distribute it among the needy people.
